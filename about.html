                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>For the past 16 years, I have worked as a chef in the culinary industry, which was a passion of mine.
                    However, as I started a family, I realized that the long and irregular hours of the industry made it
                    difficult to balance work and family life. This motivated me to pursue a career change and explore
                    my interest in programming. I am excited to bring my creativity and problem-solving skills to the
                    tech industry, and to have a career that allows me to spend more time with my loved ones.</p>
                <p>At first, it was just an experiment to see if I would be interested. But after delving into Python
                    and discovering the limitless possibilities of programming, I fell in love with it. I realized that
                    I had found my new passion, and I was eager to pursue it.</p>
                <p>Since then, I've been constantly learning and growing my skills. I'm proficient in Python,
                    JavaScript, Django, SQL, and OOP, and I'm always looking to expand my knowledge. I'm a
                    detail-oriented person who enjoys analyzing everything around me, and I'm able to manage my time
                    effectively.</p>
                <p>Outside of programming, I enjoy spending time in nature. Hiking, camping, and fishing are some of my
                    favorite activities. I also have an interest in cooking and DIY house repairs.
                    I'm happily married with a baby daughter, and spending time with my family is very important to me.
                    Honesty and doing everything with heart are values that I hold dear. I believe that if you work hard
                    and are a good person, good luck will eventually come your way.</p>
                <p>My goals for the future are to continue developing my skills and to take on more responsibilities in
                    a tech company. I'm confident that I have the ability to make a valuable contribution to any team,
                    and I'm committed to learning new technologies and gaining new skills. Ultimately, I hope to become
                    a Senior Developer and inspire others to follow their passions, just as I was inspired by Senior
                    Developers.</p>
